Fractals
========

* Displays the mandelbrot set on a complex number plane 
* When a user clicks on a complex number on the complex number coordinate system, a julia set is generated and displayed based on this complex number
* Use the keyboard to zoom in or zoom out on any fractal (zooming will recenter at mouse position):
	* The up and right arrow keys and the 'z' key will zoom in on the fractal
	* The down and left arrow keys and the 'x' key will zoom out from the fractal
* You can drag the fractal across the screen
* Previous Fractals button - allows the user to cycle through previously generated julia sets
* Textfields to allow the user to enter the real and imaginary components of the complex number for a julia set (ControlP5 library)
* Textfield for user to enter the desired number of iterations 
* Buttons for people to choose a color scheme (grayscale, orangeish, colorful)
