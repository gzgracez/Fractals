    <h1>The Mandelbrot and Julia Sets!</h1>
  </center>
  <p>
    The fractal shown will alternate between the Mandelbrot Set and a Julia Set generated based on where on the Mandelbrot Set you click.

    <p>You can download an offline application here for <a href="https://github.com/gzgracez/FractalMacApp/archive/master.zip">Macs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gzgracez/FractalMacApp/archive/windows32app.zip">Windows 32</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/gzgracez/FractalMacApp/archive/windowsApp64.zip">Windows 64</a>. This will run faster and has more options than the online version.</p>

    <h2>Interactive Online Application:</h2>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Coordinates:</u></strong> The fractals are on a complex coordinate plane. The original (before zooming) y-coordinates go from -1.5i to 1.5i and the original x-coordinates go from -2 to 2. The Julia Set is generated from the complex number that corresponds to your mouse coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Switch:</u></strong> You can click anywhere on the image of the fractal to generate either a Mandlebrot or a Julia Set (based on your mouse coordinates; the fractal will resize to the default (original) x and y range every time a new fractal is generated). The application will alternate between a Mandelbrot Set and a Julia Set, as the Julia Set will be generated from a point on the Mandlebrot Set.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><u>Zooming:</u></strong> To <strong>zoom in</strong> or <strong>zoom out</strong> on the fractal, use the keyboard. The up and right arrow keys and the 'z' key will zoom in on the fractal, while the down and left arrow keys and the 'x' key will zoom out from the fractal. Zooming in or out will recenter the image at wherever your mouse is on the fractal.

    Note: The online application works best on Firefox. Click once, and wait for the new fractal to load. Clicking multiple times will slow this process.

      <p>This is what the offline application looks like. You can cycle through your previously generated Julia Sets, enter a complex number (the real and imaginary components of a complex number) and generate a Julia Set off of that complex number, enter in the maximum number of iterations you would like the application to run for each point on the image of the fractal, and also see your mouse coordinates displayed as a complex number.</p>
